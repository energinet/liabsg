                -------------------------------------------
                This version of the LIAB distribution is 6I.



Documentation and SDK for the Linux In A Box (LIAB) microprocessor board.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This documentation and SDK pertain to the following LIAB boards:

Version 1.1 and above of the LIABNANO board.


                  *** WARNING! WARNING! ***
 
The files in the file tree of this CD-ROM are placed here for
information only.  You may browse through the CD-ROM and view the
files, but if you want to install the distribution onto your Linux-PC
do not use the 'cp' command as you will get trouble with the file
permissions. Instead, you must install the distribution using the
following procedure:


Installation
------------

Get root access and install the distribution into your Linux
PC-compatible computer using:

<become root:>
..$su
Password: <root password>
..#tar -xvj -C <installdir> -f LIABNANO-liab6I-ARM-may-2007.tar.bz2

where "LIABNANO-liab6I-ARM-may-2007.tar.bz2" is the name of the file
containing the distribution for the specific product. "<installdir>"
is the directory where you want the root of the LIABNANO
distribution. If you apply the directory "/home/mikael", you will get
a tree like this:

/--home--mikael--LIABNANO-liab6I-ARM-may-2007--+--hardware
                                                |
                                                +--pdf
                                                |
                                                +--software

To ease the editing of the files in the installed directories
(/home/mikael/LIABNANO-liab6I-ARM-may-2007/...) you should change the ownership
of all files having a userid of 998 to whatever user:group you are yourself.
You may apply the following procedure:

<become root:>
..$su
Password: <root password>
<cd to the root of the distribution>
..#cd /home/mikael/LIABNANO-liab6I-ARM-may-2007
..#find . -user 998 -exec chown <user>:<group> {} \;

where <user>:<group> could be something like "mikael:users".

Now you can edit all files, except those in "software/liabdisc/libc6"
without having to be root.


Getting started
---------------

When starting development for an ARM target you will need to install a
crosscompiler. Instructions on this, along with a small 'Hello, World!"
program can be found in the directory 'software/crosscompiler'.


Content of the CD-ROM 
---------------------

The directory "/hardware": This directory contains hardware
documentation for the LIAB boards and selected extensions. The
documentation contains schematics (diagrams), Printed Circuit Board
(PCB) layouts and programmable logic (PAL/CPLD) designs. The
documentation for a specific product is located in its respective
subdirectory.

The subdirectory "/hardware": Hardware documentation for the Version
1.1 LIABNANO.

/hardware/processorboard....:  Schematics (diagrams) for the LIABNANO
                               processor board, provided in PDF format.

The directory "/software": This directory contains software for the
LIAB boards: bootloader, Linux kernel with patches and filetree for
disc images to be loaded into the FLASH PROM.  The "/software"
directory contains a number of directories that is common for all LIAB
boards e.g. the Linux kernel and file tree. The product specific
software can be found in its respective subdirectories.

Common directories:

/software/liabkernel ..:
       Unmodified tar.bz2-file for the 2.6.16 Linux kernel, a modified
       kernel source tree for version 2.6.16 of the Linux kernel
       together with a patch-file which must be applied to make the
       kernel boot on the LIAB board.

/software/liabdisc/libc6 ...........:
       File tree for a fully operational Linux system with scripts for
       bootup and the most relevant commands. Contains: network, bash,
       vi, shared libs, /dev, /proc, Apache httpd, ftpd, telnetd, ...
       Based on Debian Testing.  Scripts are included to create a
       compressed disc image suitable for download to the FLASH PROMS
       on the LIAB. This directory is common for all LIAB boards.

/software/liabdisk/nfsbootdisk ...........:
       File tree for a fully operational Linux system with scripts for
       bootup and an extensive set of commands. Contains: all programs
       from /software/liabdisc/libc6 + gcc, gdb, make, emacs21, find, ...
       Based on Debian Testing.  The ARM platform can boot on this disk
       via NFS, providing a native ARM development platform.

/software/liabboot ...........:
      UUencoded binary for the bootloader for the version 1.1 LIABNANO
      microprocessor board. This directory also contains various
      shellscripts. NOTE: The source for the LIABNANO bootloader is
      *not* open-sourced yet! 

/software/liabaux ...........:
      Auxillerary binary packages. Contains documentation and a
      tarball of the nanosound kernelmodule and accompanying libraries
      and applications needed for playing MP3-files on the
      nanoLIAB. NOTE: The source for the nanosound module is not
      open-sourced yet.

The directory "/pdf": Documentation of the various chips used on the
LIAB boards and a users manual. E.g. the directory
"/pdf/components/atmel" contains full documentation of the AT91RM9200
chip.
