Source for (compressed) ramdisk images for the Linux In A Box board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To build a compressed ramdisk image, you must be root. Next you just
type mkfpromimage:

   ..$ su
      Password: 
   ..# cd software/liabdisc
   ..# mkfpromimage
   15+0 records in
   15+0 records out
   mke2fs 1.32 (09-Nov-2002)
   Filesystem label=
   OS type: Linux
   ... ...
   ... ...
   initrd:  77.6% -- replaced with initrd.gz
   ..#<ctrl-D>
   ..$ 

If you, for instance, want to edit the /etc/hosts-file on your LIAB, you
switch to root, edit the file using something like:

..#[ emacs | vi | jed | ... ] software/liabdisc/libc6/etc/hosts 

next you make a new ramdisk image:

..# mkfpromimage

A file called `initrd.gz' now resides in /tmp which contains the
compressed ramdisk image. You may download this image over the serial
line using the bootloader on the LIAB. You need to switch to the directory 
`software/liabboot' where you find the script `mkdisc'. For more information
on serial download, please read the `software/liabboot/README.download'-file.


NFS boot disk for the Linux In A Box board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to boot from a NFS-mounted disk instead of the onboard
RAM-disk image.  The directory 'nfsbootdisk' contain such a disk.

In order to boot from NFS you must export 'nfsbootdisk' on a linux
computer, and chenge the boot parameters on LIABARM9200 to boot from
the NFS disk. 

Make a copy of 'nfsbootdisk', preserving all permissions and special files:

..# cp -a .../nfsbootdisk /nfsbootdisk

Export '/nfsbootdisk' by adding the line 
"/nfsbootdisk 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0(rw,no_root_squash)" to /etc/exports: 

..# echo "/nfsbootdisk 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0(rw,no_root_squash)" >> /etc/exports
..# exportfs -av

Start nfs server subsystem:

..# /etc/init.d/portmap start
..# /etc/init.d/nfs start
..# /etc/init.d/nfslock start

Add these four parameters in the bootloader on the liab board,
substituting "192.168.1.230" with your linux NFS-server IP address and 
substituting "192.168.1.180" with the IP address of your LIABARM9200 board:

5: root=/dev/nfs
6: nfsroot=192.168.1.230:/nfsbootdisk
7: ip=192.168.1.180:192.168.1.230:::::off
8: noinitrd

setting params in the bootloader:

Connect to the LIAB using "cu":

   ..$ cu -l /dev/ttyS0 -s 9600
   Connected.

Reset you LIAB and enter the three dots within the first five seconds. You
will see something like:

  The bootloader will now search for a compressed kernel and file-
  system and try to boot up a Linux system. IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO
  THE BOOT LOADER, YOU MUST SEND 3 DOTS WITHIN THE NEXT 5 SECONDS: **
