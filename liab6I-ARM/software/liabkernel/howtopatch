Assuming that
  `dir1' contains the old, original and commonly distributed directory
and
  `dir2' contains the updated, new directory

then you can produce a patch-file using

diff -r -C3 -P dir1 dir2 > p

if you put yourself into `dir1' an execute

patch -p1 < ../p

then dir1 will be updated to match dir2

files in dir2 which is not in dir1 will be created as a 
consequence of the patch.

Files in dir1 which is not in dir2 will be untouched.
