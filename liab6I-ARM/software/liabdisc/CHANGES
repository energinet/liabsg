Change log for the boot disc image for the Linux In A Box board.
----------------------------------------------------------------

June  5, 2000, Midi: 
  Release of version 1.0 of the boot disc image.

July 8, 2000, Midi:
  Problems with the disc image created under RedHat 6.1 and 6.2:
  Disc images cannot be mounted. Reason: default sparse superblock
  flag has changed from "off" to "on" from RH60 to RH61! Thus, it
  must be turned off manually. According to the man-page this is done 
  using `-s0' which doesn't do the job! `-s-1' does, however.

March 10, 2001, Midi:
  More problems with mke2fs: `-s-1' doesnt work on RH 6.2 but
  `-O none' is the right way to do it...

March 10, 2001, Midi:
  fprom-program in libc5/usr/sbin updated to handle Macronix FLASH'es
  also.

June 28, 2001, Midi
  A libc6-based ramdisc distribution for the i386EX LIAB!
